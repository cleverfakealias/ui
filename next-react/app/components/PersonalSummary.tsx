      Growing up, technology was always part of my life. From playing Nintendo
      as a young child to taking apart and reassembling my family's Gateway
      computer, my curiosity for how things worked was insatiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started my career in technical support and eventually became a
      Supervisor at a '.com' startup, where I immersed myself in web development
      within the Microsoft ecosystem. Now, I'm working on a significant project
      involving numerous services and UIs, integrating with different team APIs
      and developing closed-source applications like 'Micro UIs' using React.js.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years, I've become proficient in Python, React, and Java, and I
      thrive on solving complex problems. I'm constantly learning and adapting
      to new technologies, and I'm excited about the possibility of
      transitioning to an Architect role in the future, leveraging my skills in
      AWS and various programming languages.
